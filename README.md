# Fun with CSS

This project explores advanced CSS techniques including sprites, animations, custom toggles, and interactive menus. All tasks focus on creating sophisticated UI effects using pure CSS without modifying the provided HTML structure.

## Project Structure

The project consists of four tasks, each demonstrating different CSS capabilities:

### Task 0: Sprite Languages
Create a CSS sprite implementation displaying icons for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using a single image file (`0-sprite.png`). The solution uses CSS background positioning to display different sections of the sprite image.

**Files:**
- `0-styles.css` - Sprite positioning styles
- `0-sprite.png` - Sprite image (provided)

### Task 1: Move the (under)line
Implement an animated underline effect for links that appears gradually on hover. The underline should be hidden by default and smoothly animate into view.

**Files:**
- `1-styles.css` - Underline animation styles

### Task 2: Toggle
Create a custom toggle switch UI for a checkbox input. The toggle should have distinct visual states for checked and unchecked positions with smooth transitions.

**Files:**
- `2-styles.css` - Toggle switch styles

### Task 3: Menu
Build an interactive radial menu with animated opening/closing behavior. The menu uses a hamburger icon that transforms into an X when opened, with menu items appearing in a circular pattern.

**Files:**
- `3-styles.css` - Radial menu and animation styles

## Requirements

- All solutions must be pure CSS
- No modifications to provided HTML files
- Browser compatibility for modern browsers
- Font Awesome 4.7.0 (for Task 3 icons)
